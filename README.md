# Project - Crop Yeild prediction using data visualization  

## Section 1: The Dashboard

https://public.tableau.com/views/project_17009851181100/Cropyielddashboard?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

This dashboard provides quick insights into crop yield prediction in different countries based on parameters like pesticide usage, rainfall, and temperature. It can answer questions such as which countries have the highest pesticide usage, highest yield, and highest average rainfall, and how attributes like pesticide usage, average rainfall, and temperature correlate with crop yield prediction.

## Section 2: The Dataset

The crop-yield prediction dataset used for this project can be found [here]. It contains roughly 28,000 rows and 8 columns, providing information on weather patterns (average temperature and precipitation), the average amount of pesticides applied to crops in a particular nation in a given year, and the kinds of crops harvested. Crop yield predictions are expressed in hectograms per hectare (hg/ha).

## Section 3: Dashboard Users

Potential dashboard users include:
- **Government Agencies**: Use the dashboard to develop agricultural policies and subsidies, identify possible hazards, and implement precautions to lessen their effects on the agriculture industry.
- **Farmers**: Optimize crop selection, planting dates, and resource usage based on correlations found between pesticide use, rainfall, temperature, and crop yield.
- **Supply Chain Managers**: Optimize distribution based on projected crop yields, reducing shortages or overstocking, supporting quality control and sustainability efforts, and facilitating precise transportation planning and cost reduction.
- **Agricultural Researchers and Scientists**: Analyze long-term trends and identify patterns in crop yield, enabling informed research decisions and contributing valuable insights into agricultural productivity.

## Section 4: Questions

1. What are the top 10 countries that gave the highest yield of selected crops in 2013?
2. List the countries that received the highest average rainfall from 1990 to 2013.
3. How do the temperature attribute and hg/ha attribute correlate for the selected crop?
4. How do the rainfall attribute and hg/ha attribute correlate for the selected crop?
5. How do the pesticide usage attribute and hg/ha attribute correlate for the selected crop?
6. What are the top 10 countries with the highest utilization of pesticides per hg/ha crop yield?
7. Visualize the yield fluctuations for a selected crop and country.
8. What are the top 10 countries that have the highest pesticide use per ton?
9. Which crop gave the highest yield for average rainfall in the selected country for the year 2013?
10. What are the top 3 yielded crops for the selected country for the selected year?
